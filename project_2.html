            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="spacer"></p> <!-- Aquí se añade un espacio en blanco -->
            <p>The main objective is to build a model capable of analyzing historical data of financial assets and optimizing an investment portfolio using advanced machine learning techniques and mathematical optimization. The process includes asset selection, training of predictive models, and portfolio optimization based on risk and expected return.</p>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initial Setup and Data Collection:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investor parameters were requested: investment amount, expected return, and risk aversion level.</li>
                        <li>Historical adjusted price data was downloaded for a selected list of assets, limited to the last 5 years to improve computational efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Technical Feature Generation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</strong> Measures the speed and change of price movements, used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):</strong> Helps identify changes in the direction, strength, momentum, and duration of a trend in an asset's price.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stochastic Oscillator:</strong> Compares an asset's closing price with its price range over a specified period, helping to identify potential reversal points.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Training of Machine Learning Models:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RandomForestClassifier</strong> and <strong>XGBoostClassifier</strong> were trained to predict whether an asset’s return would be positive or negative based on the generated technical features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:</strong> Applied to reduce noise and retain only the most relevant features, speeding up the model training process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Results:</strong> Despite adjustments, both models showed low accuracy, highlighting the inherent complexity and uncertainty of financial markets.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Optimization:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Efficient Frontier</strong> model was used to minimize portfolio volatility by adjusting asset weights.</li>
                        <li>Capital allocation was performed according to optimized weights to maximize risk-adjusted returns, based on the investor’s expected return.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Results Visualization and Reporting:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cumulative returns of the strategy were compared with benchmarks <strong>QQQ</strong> and <strong>SPY</strong> to assess the performance of the optimized portfolio.</li>
                        <li>Graphs were generated using <strong>Plotly</strong> to provide an interactive and comprehensible view of the strategy’s evolution compared to reference indices.</li>
                        <li><strong>QuantStats:</strong> Used for generating detailed performance reports, comparing the portfolio strategy against market benchmarks, and providing comprehensive analytics on the strategy's performance, including metrics like Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and risk-return profiles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Asset Composition Strategy Section -->
            <h4>Asset Composition Strategy</h4>
            <p>The strategy behind the composition of assets in the portfolio is guided by several key principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Selection Criteria:</strong> Assets were chosen based on their sector diversity, historical performance, and volatility. The aim was to include a balanced mix of technology, healthcare, energy, consumer, industrial, and financial sectors to achieve broad diversification.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight Optimization:</strong> Using the Efficient Frontier model, the asset weights were optimized to minimize volatility while targeting the expected return specified by the investor. This approach helps to balance the risk-reward profile of the portfolio.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment with Investor Parameters:</strong> The strategy is tailored to the investor’s risk aversion level and expected return, ensuring that the asset allocation aligns with the individual’s financial goals and tolerance for risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The following conclusions and observations highlight the limitations and appropriate use of the Machine Learning model applied in portfolio optimization:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uncertainty and Complexity:</strong> Predictive models in finance, such as those used in this project, do not guarantee high accuracy due to the unpredictable nature of the market. The low precision emphasizes the need to complement any automated strategy with careful and thoughtful analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Complementary Use of Models:</strong> While Machine Learning models provide valuable insights, they should not be the sole basis of an investment strategy. It is essential to combine these results with fundamental and technical analysis for a comprehensive market view.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management and Flexibility:</strong> The flexibility to adjust the strategy and the ability to manage risk according to changing market conditions are more crucial than the pursuit of a perfect predictive formula.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This model should be considered a decision-support tool rather than a standalone investment recommendation. Historical and simulated results do not guarantee future performance. It is vital to conduct thorough analysis and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.</p>
