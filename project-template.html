            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This project implements a complex class to analyze and project cash flow using historical data stored in a SQLite database, integrating advanced data processing, visualization with Plotly, and financial calculations. The user interface is developed in HTML5 and JavaScript, while the business logic is managed in Python using a Flask server.</p>
            
            <p>The class also allows comparing two cash flow projections to observe variations in estimates of cash inflows and outflows, facilitating strategic decision-making based on different financial scenarios.</p>

            <p>Additionally, the class features an advanced method that calculates the additional cash needed to reach a target balance. This method evaluates projected inflows and outflows, adjusting cash entries as needed to maintain the balance at the desired level, providing a useful tool for treasury planning and strategic decision-making.</p>

            <h4>Code Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete and Functional Structure:</strong> The <code>AdvancedCashFlowAnalyzer</code> class covers a wide range of features, from database connection, data retrieval, and filtering, to the integration of assumptions and interactive graph generation. This structure is ideal for projects requiring detailed cash flow analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Pandas and Plotly:</strong> The code uses <code>pandas</code> for data handling and <code>plotly</code> to generate interactive charts, facilitating the understanding of results and allowing professional presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling and Logging:</strong> It includes robust exception handling, logging errors in detail, which is essential for identifying and correcting issues during execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Analysis Parameters:</strong> Methods allow adjusting various parameters such as dates, levels, currencies, chart types, and more, providing high flexibility to analyze different scenarios and customize the analysis according to user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Assumptions:</strong> The <code>process_supuestos</code> method allows integrating additional assumptions into the analysis, which is very useful for adjusting calculations to specific scenarios that may influence projected cash flows.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Balance Calculation Functions:</strong> It uses a method to calculate the projected balance, simulating how the cash balance would evolve under different conditions of income and outflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Projection Comparison:</strong> The class allows comparing two cash flow projections to assess differences in estimates, facilitating the analysis of variations in cash inflows and outflows.</li>
            </ul>
